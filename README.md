Israel's tallest mountain, Mount Hermon, is situated on the border with Syria and Lebanon. It is a well-liked tourist destination, especially in the winter when it is snow-covered and offers opportunities for snowboarding and skiing.
The number of people who ski and visit Mount Hermon grow from year to year, according to data from the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, the average number of visitors to Mount Hermon during the winter season is around 250,000-300,000 people per year.
Predicting the opening days of Mount Hermon in Israel based solely on weather data can be challenging due to the unpredictable nature of weather in the region. Israel's weather can be highly variable, and even small changes in temperature or precipitation can have a significant impact on the amount of snow on the mountain. Additionally, the mountain's infrastructure and facilities may not always be able to handle heavy amounts of snow, which can further impact the timing of the resort's opening. As a result, many people in Israel who enjoy skiing may choose to travel outside of the country for their ski vacations, where they can rely on more consistent snow conditions and well-established ski resorts.

In our project, we are attempting to predict the opening days of Mount Hermon in Israel based on weather data. This can be very helpful to people who want to ski or visit the resort, as it provides them with more information to plan their trips and potentially avoid disappointment or inconvenience due to unexpected changes in the resort's opening schedule. our project has the potential to help people who enjoy skiing and winter sports to plan their trips to Mount Hermon with more confidence, knowing that they have more information about when the resort is likely to be open.
We first used Python and Selenium to scrape weather data from the Israel Meteorological Service website for the winter seasons of 2019, 2021, and 2022. We chose to exclude 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on the opening days of the resort.
We are defining a year as the period between November of the previous year and March of the following year. This is a common definition for the winter season in Israel and aligns with the typical period when the resort is open.
We reached out to Mount Hermon to obtain the opening days for the resort during the winter seasons of the three years you are analyzing. It's great to hear that they were willing to help and provided us with the relevant information, we take the data they gave us and adding it to our data.

Once we have obtained the weather and opening days data for the three winter seasons, we will need to clean and preprocess it. This may involve filling in missing values and removing unnecessary data, such as irrelevant features or duplicate entries.
Once the data is ready, we can begin to visualize it to gain insights into the relationships between weather conditions and opening patterns. We can use a variety of visualization techniques, such as bar plots, box plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to explore the data and identify any patterns or trends.
With a better understanding of the data, we can then begin to build a machine learning model using techniques such as logistic regression. We will need to train and test our model using the data we have collected and evaluate its performance in terms of accuracy. Ultimately, we hope to create a model that can predict with 0.75 accuracy whether the Mount Hermon resort will be open or closed on a given day based on the weather data. This could be a valuable tool for people who enjoy skiing and snowboarding, allowing them to plan their trips with more confidence and avoid disappointment.
